  "description": "To precisely control a robot, especially one with a complex multi-jointed structure like a humanoid, a deep understanding of its motion capabilities is essential. This chapter delves into the mathematical foundations of robot motion: kinematics and dynamics. These concepts provide the tools to describe, analyze, and predict how a robot moves and how forces and torques influence that movement.",
