  "description": "While earlier chapters explored the intelligent capabilities of Physical AI and the sophisticated algorithms governing robotic behavior, these would be impossible without the underlying hardware: the sensors that perceive the world and the actuators that enable physical action. This chapter delves deeper into the technologies behind sensing and actuation, crucial components that bridge the digital intelligence with the physical reality of humanoid robotics.",
