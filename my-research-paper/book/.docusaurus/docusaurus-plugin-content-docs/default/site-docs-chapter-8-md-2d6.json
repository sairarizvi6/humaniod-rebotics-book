  "description": "The ability to learn from experience and adapt to novel situations is a hallmark of intelligence, and for Physical AI and humanoid robotics, it is crucial for achieving true autonomy and versatility. Robots that can learn are not confined to pre-programmed tasks but can improve their performance, acquire new skills, and adjust to dynamic and unpredictable environments. This chapter explores the core mechanisms of robotic learning and adaptation.",
