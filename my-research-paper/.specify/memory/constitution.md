# my-research-paper Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Docusaurus for Content
This project uses Docusaurus as the primary framework for creating and managing the book content. All documentation and written materials will be structured to be compatible with Docusaurus's content rendering engine.

### II. Local-First Workflow
All development, including content creation and site generation, will be performed and validated locally. There will be no automatic pushing of changes to a remote repository. This ensures the user maintains full control over their version history.

### III. Spec-Kit Plus for Development
The project will adhere to the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology using Spec-Kit Plus. This includes using specifications to guide content creation and automated tooling to ensure consistency.

### IV. AI-Assisted Development
AI tools, including Claude Code, will be utilized to assist in content generation, code creation, and problem-solving, accelerating the development process.

### V. Content as Code
The book's content (Markdown files, etc.) is treated as source code. It will be managed, versioned, and maintained with the same rigor as application code.
